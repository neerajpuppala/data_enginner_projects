# Project Description's

1. Insurance Upgrades:
The major focus of the project is to design and develop a system for tracking and managing upgrades of insurance policies. The other main areas of concern are the design of a database for storing information about customers, policies, and transactions, and the implementation of analytics in view of gaining insights into customer behavior, policy upgrade trends, and business opportunities. It enhances the decision-making process in an insurance company by automating and streamlining the upgrade process.


2. Loan Insights:
In this project, a relational database system is designed that can be used for tracking loan issuances and repayments, and customer information. Additionally, it targets the performance analysis of loans, the history of repayment, and customer segmentation. These varied insights thus help the financial institutions make informed decisions about the loan policies and opportunities to improve customer service and financial forecasting.
  
3. London's Travel Network:
The main goal of this project is to analyze data from London's travel network to optimize public transportation, reduce congestion, and improve travel efficiency across the city. This involves processing large datasets related to transportation modes, including buses, trains, and underground systems, as well as road congestion data. The project aims to provide data-driven insights that can be used by city planners and transport authorities to enhance commuter experiences and make the cityâ€™s travel system more efficient.
   
4. Students Mental Health:
This project is centered on analyzing student mental health data to identify key stress factors and trends. The goal is to provide universities with insights that help improve student support services. By analyzing various factors such as academic pressure, social interactions, and external challenges, the project aims to recommend actionable steps to promote better mental health outcomes for students.
